        Arrays and hashes can be difficult to distinguish from eachother. They are both ways of storing information in one area. However, they do have their differences and best instances to be used. Here we will be briefly looking over those!
      </p>
      <p>
        You can think of arrays like lists, in which the most important information are the values themselves.In arrays its not as important to label those values a certain way
      </p>

      <p>
        ex. array = [ 1,2,3]
      </p>

      <p>
        Hashes are more like pairs of information since you can specify the value as well as the key assigned to that value.
      </p>
      <p>
        ex.
        hash = {
        :one => 1,
        :two => 2,
        :three =>3,
      }
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice in hashes the key value, which is on the left, is shown because it is manipulatable and therefore gives the coder more control.
