          The first thing that should be explained is what Git and GitHub are. Git is a program run in your command line that allows you to store, manage, and even go back to different points in the development of a file. For example, I could go back to when I had just wrote the first line, even if I had already gotten to the end.You get to establish these points as you deem fit which is another reason why it's so handy. I can mark when I was working on a certain part of a file specifically so that I know what I was working on if I wanted to go back to it in the future. It also helps if you somehow deleted part of your file. You can always go back to an earlier version to retrieve it again.

          Another great tool for not only backing up files but sharing them is GitHub. It keeps your code in a safe place in case anything should happen to the files on your computer. In addition, it allows for easy collaboration on a single project by creating different channels for people to edit the code, and then come back together to discuss the changes before they are final.
