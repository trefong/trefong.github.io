    <h2>What is "on Rails"?</h2>
    <h3>Thursday, March 31 2016</h4>

    <p>
      A lot of the time you will hear the phrase, "Ruby on Rails", but what does that actually mean? In this post we will briefly dive into that question so you can know what you're working with as a programmer using Ruby.
    </p>

    <p>
      To put it shortly, when people say "Ruby on Rails", they mean they are working with the Ruby language in the Rails framework. It is a MVC or model-view-controller framework which means that it allows you to view what you are doing in a way that you can easily understand as a person... rather than a computer. When you use Ruby on Rails, it  creates an environment that encourages certain kind of coding and therefore creates a standard to all who use it. As the amount of coders and  those who use the language Ruby continues to grow, it is easy to see why standardizing language patterns is extremely important.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's primary function is to extend the Ruby language by combining it with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, therefore simplifying the process of building complicated websites. In addition, it is also now an open source software, so it continues to get better with time.
