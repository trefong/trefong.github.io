    <p>
      I really appreciated the fact that DBC had us build a website throughout Phase 0. It gave us a chance to keep up our skills we learned in the first week as well as review our skills as the weeks went on. I immediately saw the benefits after I had done the first blog post. I also, realized however, that I didn't like building a website as much as I had thought I would. Coming into DBC I was interested in web design, but I now realize I didn't like it as much as I liked learning Ruby and JavaScript. It was really surprising! The reason for this being that it was a little too straightforward and I like the problem solving aspect of being a backend developer in addition to the fact that I felt like I wasn't good at it. Especially after seeing other peoples' sites I felt like I didn't hae a natural eye for what looked good for a web page. I found it hard to keep my site simple without it looking too simple. I also felt more gratification when I had finished the Ruby or JavaScript challenges than when I finished the challenges in HTML or CSS. I have considered as well that I just might need more practice in building a website. So far, it has all simply  been for completing the challenges. I think to make a final decision, I need to invest more effort into the aesthetics.
