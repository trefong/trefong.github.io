    Hey there, and thanks for visiting! I hope that you can get a good understanding of my work, what I'm capable of doing, and a little about my background. You'll be able to take a look at samples of some work I've done accompanied by an explaination as well as my work history.
  </p>
  <p>
    For starters, my name is Traci, and I'm currently studying software engineering at DevBootcamp. After which, I hope to become a full stack developer. Previous to DevBootcamp, I had recently graduated from UC Riverside with a Media and Cultural Studies degree and was working as an assistant. I wasn't happy with where I was and wanted to take a step to better my professional career. My cousin had actualy went through DevBootcamp a few years ago and encouraged me to apply, and now here I am!

  All my life I've been an active person. As a child up until my last year in high school, my parents were always shuttling my older sister and I to our basketball games. At times it got a little crazy, and I'm very thankful that they were so willing to endure all of that driving! Nowadays I don't play as much anymore, but I try to stay as active as possible by working out at home and going on hikes with friends around the bay area. If you've never been hiking here, you're missing out! I love discovering hidden gem places and just enjoying the outdoors. Staying healthy and active is definitely one of my top priorities!

    Now that you know a little more about myself, maybe you can put a face behind all the work that you will see here. So go ahead and take a look around and click on any of the thumbnails below to be redirected to my pages. Hope to hear from you soon!
